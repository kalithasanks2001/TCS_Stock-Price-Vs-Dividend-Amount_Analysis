# TCS Stock Price Vs Dividend Amount Analysis

##Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the relationship between **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) stock prices** and **dividend amounts** using Python. The goal is to develop a predictive model to forecast future stock prices and dividend amounts based on historical data.

##Features

- Data Analysis: Detailed analysis of TCS stock prices and dividend amounts using statistical techniques.
- Prediction Model: Utilizes machine learning models to predict future stock prices and dividend payouts.
- Visualization: Generates visualizations to showcase trends and relationships between stock prices and dividend payouts.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you'll need the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn

Files

-TCS_Stock-Price_Vs_Dividend-Amount_Analysis.py: The main Python script that analyzes and models the stock price and dividend data.
-Data files (not included in this repo): Historical stock price and dividend data in CSV format.

Usage
-Clone this repository:
---Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TCS-Stock-Price-Vs-Dividend-Amount-Analysis.git
cd TCS-Stock-Price-Vs-Dividend-Amount-Analysis
-Ensure you have the required data files in the working directory. The data should include columns for Date, Stock Price, and Dividend Amount.
-Run the Python script:
---Copy code
python TCS_Stock-Price_Vs_Dividend-Amount_Analysis.py
-The script will perform the analysis and output the following:
     -Data visualizations (trend lines, correlation plots)
     -Stock price and dividend amount predictions

Results
-The output will display key insights into the correlation between stock prices and dividend amounts.
-The predictive model will forecast future stock prices and dividends for a specified year.
